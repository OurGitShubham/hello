      <p>29 sept I wake up at 5 am …… a thought suddenly strikes me giving a cutest message that I have to go with my school junior friend…..🧡🧡😋😋 <br>
Her name is Sneha…… but I called her snow😁….i m a little shy guy in my school I will never approach her for the friendship but my brother did that and because of my
 brother stated talking her and sitting with her in school bus then becauseof my brother  we also started talking…. yup  now we become really good friends ……<br>lookwise.... she is cute with a specs bigger than her face but still that suits her and become a part of her personality ……….. ok come back today  I have a good smile on my face as I m going to hangout with her 😋😋  .
</p>
<h3> excitement level</h3>
<p>I m a guy who study in morning ....so I started studing but I can’t because of the excitement for today ….😉……again and again I m thinking what will I do when I will meet her and the main point is she should not felt bored with me……. So I try to plan out the conversation we could do to….
Seriously this is childish but I stated typing  point in my mobile note pad😜😜🤦‍♂‍…. I note down many things there  ….. I m eagerly waiting for  clock to become 11 o’clock…… but time is passing slooowly…..
</p>

<h3>The meet🤩</h3>
<p>Ok so at 11 aprox I leave the  hostel for the near by metro station where we decided to meet😋😁😁😍 …. I reached at 11:35 and she got late  till she came I was really nervous :0…….she came on gate no 2 so I have to cross the road to meet her ……
We shake hands…….. my behaviour become soo awkward 😒😒🤦‍‍ …….i m not geting what to say but I smiled😊……. And she smiling toooo she s saying something which I m not getting……..then I ask  stupid question I said why u came sneha  where is my snow  and that time in my mind i say wow shubham what  the stupid question but I don’t get it...... she is replying to that with good sense 😎😎 … she like this stupid question😶😶
</p>
<h3>i m annoying....🤦‍♀️</h3>
<p>Now we started our way to Dlf mall😉🧡….. in metro I m super excited as she is with me one thought always coming in the mind is not to let her feel bore….so I quickly check out my prepared notes about what I could talk ….. I m fully focused on her and  that makes most of the time landed on the wrong station or taking the wrong metro🤦‍♂‍🤦‍♂‍…….but she is aware of what is happening around she reminds me that we arrive on station and we have to change the metro😂……but we landed on wrong station which is really far from our dlf this whole situation make me feel dumbo…….she  said that we can go to some restaurant here only but that was not the thing I want I said please no here and there only dlf…….. then we started again for dlf …….</p>
<h3>things bocoming fine😊.....</h3>
<p>Whatever the thing is this stupidity of mine makes us talk a lot and I m becoming comfortable with her 😉😉🧡 once I m comfortable with someone then I can talk about anything to everything …….then what everything is becoming stable we are on a right track 👍👍…. Also  we don’t get the seat we enjoying standing and talking then she got the seat and she sat there one seat got empty on the same stack of seats where she is sitting I have no guts to say a passenger to shit so that I can sit with her but she do it she said her near by passenger to shift so that I could sit with that time I really feels great no w the phone notes are of no use i can talk her with full confidence anything . now all talks are original from me not pre planned . <br>
  No  we are at station …. I said her to walk  alone as there were small kids trying to sell the roses…. But still I got captured  with kid🤷‍♀‍ …………….. whlile going from station to mall she is amazed to see a small type of vehicle I think that is the combination of an auto and tata nano😂😂

<h3>DLF MALL 😍</h3>
<p>We arrives to our dlf……..its really a great mall but we first goes to wash room (hey what,not together😜) then came out girls took lot of time to came out and obviously she is also a girl ….i have to wait for her …….now everytime I sees her I m fine I m good I could talk her …….\
Now what we could only roam around and click photos ………..
We went to food court …
The most pain full thing she is doing fast this day…….so not taking a meal
</p>
<h3>coffe and cold coffee...</h3>
<p>She took a coffee and I took a cold coffee🤦‍♂‍🤦‍♂‍ she is new to that place she is seeing here
  and there  trying to understand the culture around …….
There is tiny spoon  with the coffee to mix the sugar we laugh on that a lot………..
We are talking  a lot, first I m speaking speaking and speaking …………….
She is listening like so mature girl  ……….. now she broke up the silence
from her she tries to  explain me  her experience till now of her college journey
 I stated listening to her a point came dhe got so excited and laugh so loudly that everyone
  is seeing us😂😂😜…..we are talking discussing and now I don’t wanna go back just wanna listen to her ,

</p>
<h3>she has lots....i felt that</h3>
<p>
that time first I realize that she is eager to confess everything but she is not finding the right person ……..
or may be there is no  one who ask” tell me Sneha how you ar e going…..”
I felt so blessed listening  to her and now opposite to to the morning time is passing soo  fastly  I just want to stop this moment and get blessed from her
By this experience I realize we must ask our love ones timely that “oye kya chl rah h zindigi m chl na kahi ghumne chalete h” ….. this all will get the way to make close to them
i really enjoy her listening
</p>

<h3>going back</h3>
<p>Ok now I have no power to stop the moment and we  have to leave for station😢😢  but I really enjoy her…..
Now we r in metro I m seeing some satisfaction in me that this day is becoming great ……
And she also look fine now we are smiling at each other……….

<h3>the most interesting😊😋</h3>
<p>We gets out the last station and she said me to drop to her college as it is becoming to late so ………
Now we have to cross the road (the most interesting part 😜)
Ghazibad traffic is huge it is becoming difficult for us to cross the road  I was thinking t hold her hand but I cant…….  so we  started to cross the road in between of road she suddenly holds my hand 😁😋 I cant express that emotion because my stomach gets tickling  in the middle if the road I saw left car is coming I said to me control Shubham u have to cross the road 🤣🤣🤣….then the other lane came to cross she again hold my hand my stomach stated tickling again after crossing we realize that we have to go on other road now again we have to cross ...this time i said to myself “I am bigger yrr.... come on i can  hold her hand and make her feel secure"...now  this time I hold her hand and control my tickilg that giving  laugh ……  now i m feeling so lighter so calm so happy  ("ye kabhi ni socha tha ki hath pakadne ke lia apne ap ko motivate krna padega")it is  a good part of the day😉😎😊….
